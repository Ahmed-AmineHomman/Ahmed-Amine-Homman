ðŸ‘‹ Hello everybody! ðŸ‘‹

I'm @Ahmed-AmineHomman, a research project leader at ClaraVista.
I previously worked as a Data Analyst at AddUp and did a PhD at Ecoles des Ponts ParisTech (Paris-Est University) in Applied Mathematics.
You will find my full resume in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedaminehomman/).

During my PhD, I specialized in Molecular Simulation, where I wrote codes in C++ in order to perform simulations using the [Dissipative Particle Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissipative_particle_dynamics) model/
You'll find the article resuming my PhD work [here](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01180558).
Since the end of my PhD, I switched to Data Science and Machine Learning using Python.

I'm interested in machine learning frameworks for usual marketing applications such as product recommendations, NLP and classification algorithms.
I am also still interested in everything revolving around simulation, and particularly in my first love which is Molecular Simulation.
In addition, I am also interested in the quite new Julia language, and I will try to learn a bit about this langage in order to improve in it.

Finally, if I can, I will gladly offer my help to any major scientific python library such as @scikit-learn or @statsmodels.

Take care, and welcome to my profile!
