# ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm @Ahmed-AmineHomman, a research project leader at ClaraVista. My journey in the world of data and research began as a Data Analyst at AddUp, followed by a PhD in Applied Mathematics from Ã‰coles des Ponts ParisTech (Paris-Est University). You can find my full resume on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedaminehomman/).

During my PhD, I specialized in Molecular Simulation, developing C++ codes for simulations based on the [Dissipative Particle Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissipative_particle_dynamics) model. My PhD work is summarized in this [article](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01180558).

Since completing my PhD, I've transitioned to Data Science and Machine Learning, primarily using Python. My expertise includes machine learning frameworks for marketing applications such as product recommendations, natural language processing, and classification algorithms.

In the past year, I have wholeheartedly embraced the advancements in Generative AI, gaining strong experience and specializing in this exciting field. This area has become my primary focus, and I am passionately exploring and contributing to the development of these innovative models.

Despite my shift to AI, my interest in molecular simulation remains strong, harking back to my foundational work in this area. I am also intrigued by the relatively new Julia programming language and aim to deepen my proficiency in it.

Whenever possible, I am keen to contribute to major scientific Python libraries such as @scikit-learn and @statsmodels.

Thank you for visiting my profile!

Take care,
Ahmed-Amine Homman
