# ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm @Ahmed-AmineHomman, a research project leader at ClaraVista. My journey in the world of data and research began as a Data Analyst at AddUp, followed by a PhD in Applied Mathematics from Ã‰coles des Ponts ParisTech (Paris-Est University). You can find my full resume on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedaminehomman/).

During my PhD, I specialized in Molecular Simulation, developing C++ codes for simulations based on the [Dissipative Particle Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissipative_particle_dynamics) model. My PhD work is summarized in this [article](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01180558). Since completing my PhD, I've transitioned to Data Science and Machine Learning, primarily using Python. My expertise includes machine learning frameworks for marketing applications such as product recommendations, natural language processing, and classification algorithms.

Since early 2023, I have wholeheartedly embraced the advancements in Generative AI, gaining strong experience and specializing in this exciting field. This area has become my primary focus, and I am passionately exploring and contributing to the development of these innovative models.
