# ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm @Ahmed-AmineHomman, a research project leader with a PhD in Applied Mathematics from Ã‰coles des Ponts ParisTech. Over the years, I have explored the fascinating intersections of Molecular Simulation, Data Science, and, more recently, Generative AI. From developing C++ codes for complex physical simulations to applying machine learning for marketing applications, my work reflects my passion for solving challenging problems through rigorous analysis and innovative technology.

This space is a window into the experiments, insights, and technical reflections that define my journey as a researcher and developer. Here, youâ€™ll find studies on generative AI models, deep dives into data-driven solutions, and explorations of cutting-edge tools and methodologies. My aim is to share knowledge that is practical and inspiring, whether you're a fellow researcher, a curious professional, or simply someone fascinated by the world of AI and modeling.

Since early 2023, Iâ€™ve focused extensively on Generative AI, an area I find both transformative and exciting. This blog allows me to document my learnings, share intriguing findings, and connect with others who share this enthusiasm. I hope to spark meaningful discussions and contribute to the growing community of researchers and practitioners in the field.

Feel free to connect, ask questions, or share your thoughts: collaboration and dialogue are at the heart of progress. Together, letâ€™s dive into the incredible world of science and technology! ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to my blog!
